# The opengl interface

`opengl` allows access to the OpenGL stack and, consequently, OpenGL hardware, which may be needed for certain types of graphical applications and those that use [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) libraries for computation. See [Adding OpenGL/GPU support to a snap](adding-opengl-gpu-support-to-a-snap.md) for more information on how to use this interface.

**Auto-connect**: yes

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](interface-management.md) and [Supported interfaces](supported-interfaces.md) for further details on how interfaces are used.
