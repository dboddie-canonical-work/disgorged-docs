# The packagekit-control interface

`packagekit-control` allows control of the [PackageKit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/PackageKit/) service, giving privileged access to native package management on the system.

This interface is intended to work in tandem with [the AppStream interface](/t/the-appstream-metadata-interface/13050). Snaps distributed via the public [Snap store](https://snapcraft.io/store) are not typically granted auto-connection for this interface.

**[Auto-connect](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--auto-connections)**: no</br>
**[Super-privileged](/t/super-privileged-interfaces/34740)**: yes</br>

Requires snapd version _2.41+_.`

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](/t/interface-management/6154) and [Supported interfaces](/t/supported-interfaces/7744) for further details on how interfaces are used.
