# Deprecation notice: 8

**The 'build' keyword has been replaced by 'override-build'**

_introduced in snapcraft 2.41_

The `build` scriptlet was originally introduced as a way to override the default `build` step with one's own logic.

However, as part of an effort to add support for Snapcraft to have this for _all_ lifecycle steps (i.e. not just build), a new scriptlet has been added that works similarly called `override-build`.

The biggest difference is that you can now call `snapcraftctl build` to run the default `build` step.

See [Deprecation notices](/t/deprecation-notices/8396/2)  for further announcements.
