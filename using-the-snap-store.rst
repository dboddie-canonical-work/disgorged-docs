Using the Snap Store
====================

To access the Snap Store, go to https://snapcraft.io/store and either `create a developer account </t/creating-your-developer-account/6760>`__ or login with your developer account credentials.

   ℹ For larger projects and ISVs, it might be useful to also `create a brand account <https://snapcraft.io/docs/t/creating-snap-store-brand-accounts/6271>`__ in the name of the aroject or company.

After a snap has been `created </t/creating-a-snap/6799>`__, tested, and `released </t/releasing-your-app/6795>`__ to the `Snap Store <https://snapcraft.io/store>`__, the Store’s web interface can be used to perform the following functions:

-  `edit metadata </t/store-listing-and-branding/16397#heading--metadata>`__ to make a snap easily discoverable
-  `add media </t/store-listing-and-branding/16397#heading--media>`__ to show off your application and its brand
-  `manage releases </t/release-management/12442>`__ and channels
-  `track installation </t/snap-store-metrics/12556>`__ and usage statistics
-  `control who can see a snap </t/public-private-and-unlisted-snaps/19744>`__ with public, private and unlisted visibility

..

   ℹ Every device using the Snap Store has access to the same catalogue of software. A `Dedicated Snap Store <https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/build-store/>`__, however, allows vendors running Ubuntu Core and snap-based devices to control exactly what snaps are available, and when.
