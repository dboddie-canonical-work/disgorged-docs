For Qt4 applications currently the recommended way to snap them is via the use of the `desktop-qt4` part provided by [the Snapcraft Desktop Helpers project](https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers).

Merge the definition the `desktop-qt4` part from <https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers/blob/master/snapcraft.yaml>  into your Snapcraft recipe, with the `source` property changed to <https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers.git>

```yaml
parts
  desktop-qt4:
    source: https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers.git

        ...stripped...

```

> **NOTE:** In order to keep the integration up-to-date for the best user experience, you should check if the definition has been changed periodically.

Insert `${SNAP}/bin/desktop-launch` (or `desktop-launch` if the command search `PATH`s allows) into the app's command chain:

```yaml
apps:
  qt4app:
    command: desktop-launch qt4app-launch qt4app
```

If you're using the `full` adapter, insert the `bin/desktop-launch` launcher into the list of the `command-chain` key of the `apps._app_name_` property instead:

```yaml
apps:
  qt4app:
    adapter: full
    command: bin/qt4app
    command-chain:
    - bin/desktop-launch
    - bin/qt4app-launch
```
