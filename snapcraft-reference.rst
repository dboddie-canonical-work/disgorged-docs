This topic is currently under construction as we start to migrate our current documentation to use the `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__ framework.

See `Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation <https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation>`__ for more details.

Our Snapcraft *Reference section* is for when you need to know which plugins we offer, which interfaces you can use, and what you can add to snapcraft.yaml.

Alternatively, the Snapcraft tutorials section contain step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Snapcraft is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Snapcraft and building your first snap.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Snapcraft, our How-to guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. They’ll help you achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Finally, for a better understanding of how Snapcraft works, and how it can be used and configured, our *Explanation* section enable you to expand your knowledge and become better at building snaps with Snapcraft.
