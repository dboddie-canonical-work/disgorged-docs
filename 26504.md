The `media-control` interface permits access to media control devices and Video4Linux (V4L) devices via the Linux kernel's [Media Controller API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/mediactl/media-controller.html).

**Auto-connect**: no

The kernel media controller API allows connecting and configuring media hardware subsystems. These operations should be considered privileged since the driver assumes trusted input, and therefore this interface requires manual connection.

### Code examples

The test code can be found in the snapd repository: https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/blob/master/interfaces/builtin/media_control_test.go
