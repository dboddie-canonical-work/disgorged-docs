# The plainbox-provider plugin

The `plainbox-provider` plugin can be used to create parts containing a [PlainBox](https://launchpad.net/plainbox) test collection, known as a *provider*.

PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of a Python 3 library, development tools, documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or certification applications, alongside authors creating tests for such applications.

For further details, see the [PlainBox Documentation](https://git.launchpad.net/plainbox/tree/docs). To find out more about authoring a PlainBox provider, refer to [Providers]( https://git.launchpad.net/plainbox/plain/docs/author/providers.rst).

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources". For more information, see [Snapcraft parts metadata](snapcraft-parts-metadata.md).
