**Auto-connect**: no

As NETLINK_CONNECTOR is not finely mediated and app-specific, use of this interface allows communications via all Netlink connectors. See [Kernel connector](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/connector/connector.txt) (on kernel.org) for further details.

Requires snapd version _2.26+_.

The snap of the [usbtop]() kernel module, used to monitor the bandwidth of USB buses and devices, uses the _netlink-audit_ interface:

The source code for this interface is in the *snapd* repository:
