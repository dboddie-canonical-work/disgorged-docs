They provide access to PulseAudio and will provide access to other sound servers in the future.

`pulseaudio` enables access to the PulseAudio sound server for sound playback and recording.

**Auto-connect**: no

*Note: The [`audio-playback`](/t/the-audio-playback-interface/13089) interface is auto-connected.*
