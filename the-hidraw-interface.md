# The hidraw interface

`hidraw` enables raw access to USB and Bluetooth Human Interface (*hidraw*) devices. This interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to hardware devices.

**Auto-Connect**: no
**Attributes**:
- Should specify a single path attribute:
  * `path` (slot): path to hidraw device node e.g. /dev/hidraw0
- Or three attributes:
  * `usb-vendor` (slot): integer representing the USB Vendor ID, must be in range 0 < vid <= 65535
  * `usb-product` (slot): integer representing the USB Product ID, must be in range  0 <= vid <= 65535
  * `path` (slot): path where a symlink will be created to the device e.g. `/dev/hidraw-mydevice`

To use a hidraw device, the snap developer must add `plugs: [ hidraw ]` to a snap's [snapcraft.yaml](/t/the-snapcraft-format/8337). The snap user can then access a specific hidraw device with an [interface connection](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--manual-connections).

Use  `snap interface hidraw` to see which hidraw devices are available on the system.

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via the path specified by the connected slot.

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](/t/interface-management/6154) and [Supported interfaces](/t/supported-interfaces/7744) for further details on how interfaces are used.
