The `classic-support` interface sets special permissions for the [classic snap](https://snapcraft.io/classic), effectively giving device ownership to its connected snaps.

This interface is intended to be used only with [Ubuntu Core](/t/glossary/14612#heading--ubuntu-core). 

Requires snapd version _2.23+_.
