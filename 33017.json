When snapcraft runs and parses this file, it will use the declared information to build the snap.

The base also defines the operating system version for the snap build instance in the virtual machine or container launched by Snapcraft. For instance, base: core18 means that Snapcraft will launch an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine or container, the set of tools and libraries used inside the snap will originate from the Ubuntu 18.04 repository archives, and the snap applications will “think” they are running on top of an Ubuntu 18.04 system, regardless of what the actual underlying Linux distribution is.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eParts\u003c/strong\u003e - describes the components that will be used to assemble the snap.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eApps\u003c/strong\u003e - describes the applications and their commands that can be run in an installed snap.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to note several additional details:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA snap may contain one or more parts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA snap may contain one or more applications\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eParts can be pre-assembled binaries or they may be compiled as part of the build process.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe parts section of the snapcraft.yaml file uses Snapcraft build system or language-specific plugins to simplify the build process.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe parts section may also include a list of \u003ca href=\"/t/build-and-staging-dependencies/11451\"\u003ebuild packages\u003c/a\u003e (build-packages) that will be used to create the snap applications but will not be included in the final snap.

For instance, if source points to a Git repository, the pull step will clone that repository.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBuild\u003c/strong\u003e - Snapcraft constructs the part from the previously pulled components. Since the snap ecosystem supports multiple types of applications (C, Java, Go, Rust, Python, etc.), the build definition also needs to include a specification on how to construct the part. This is done by declaring a \u003ca href=\"/t/snapcraft-plugins/4284\"\u003eSnapcraft plugin\u003c/a\u003e. Parts are processed linearly, unless there is a dependency order declared.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eStage\u003c/strong\u003e - Snapcraft copies the built parts into the staging area. Parts are not ordered at this point, and there might be an additional level of processing to ensure the snap contains the required files, and that there are no conflicts between parts. This is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this tutorial.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePrime\u003c/strong\u003e - Snapcraft copies the staged components into the priming area, where the files will be placed in their final locations (folder and files path hierarchy) for the resulting snap. The prime step is similar to the stage step, but it may exclude certain components from the stage step.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePack\u003c/strong\u003e - Snapcraft packs the assembled components in the prime directory into a single archive.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"heading--output\"\u003eSnapcraft build output\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe artifact of a successful Snapcraft build run is a snap file, which is itself a compressed Squashfs archive distinguished by the .snap suffix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snap may contain one or more files that allow the applications to run without reliance on the underlying host system’s libraries.
