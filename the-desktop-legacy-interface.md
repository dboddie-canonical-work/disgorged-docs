# The desktop-legacy interface

`desktop-legacy` allows privileged access to desktop legacy methods.

**Auto-connect**: yes
**Transitional**: yes

Requires snapd version _2.28+_.

See [The desktop interfaces](/t/the-desktop-interfaces/2042) for further details.



**Condition to Connect**:
* If your snap has a graphical interface, you *should* connect to this interface.
* If your snap is expected to receive text input from CJKV(Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese etc.) users, you **must** connect to this interface, *failing to do so will cause frustration to these users*.

**Compatibility Information**:
* Remote parts provided by [ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers: Various launchers for snapcraft wiki parts](https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers) must be adopted by the snap in order to make input method support work.
* Currently snapd is compatible with iBus and Fcitx input method framework, Fcitx support is currently limited due to a bug in ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers - [link](https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers/pull/156)
