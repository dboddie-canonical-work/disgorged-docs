This topic is currently under construction as we start to migrate our current documentation to use the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework.

See [ Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation](https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation) for more details.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with _snapcraft_ (after following a tutorial, for example), our _How-to_ guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications.

Our How-to guides help you achieve an end result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

| **How-to-guides** | Get stuff done|
|--|--|
| [Snapcraft quickstart](/t/snapcraft-quickstart/32983) | The steps required to create , build and publish a snap  |
| [Build a checklist](/t/snapcraft-checklist/10926) | Gather everything you need to build a snap |
| [Iterate over a build](/t/iterating-over-a-build/12143) |  Check build state, view logs, and probe  environment variables |
| [Classic confinement](/t/34416) | Build snaps with classic confinement |

Alternatively, our tutorials section contain step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Snapcraft is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Snapcraft and building your first snap.

Take a look at our *Reference section* when you need to know which options can be used, what functions the API supports, which rescue modes are supported and the contents of *gadget.yaml*,

Finally, for a better understanding of how Snapcraft works, and how it can be used and configured, our *Explanation* section enable you to expand your knowledge and become better at building snaps with Snapcraft.
