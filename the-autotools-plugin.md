# The autotools plugin

The `autotools` plugin is useful for [Automake/Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) based parts.

Autotools-based projects are easy to recognise, as they're typically built and installed with the following commands: `./configure && make && make install`.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for [sources](snapcraft-parts-metadata.md#heading--source). For more information, see [Snapcraft parts metadata](snapcraft-parts-metadata.md).

Additional features and syntax are dependent on which [base](base-snaps.md) is being used, as outlined below:

- [base: core22](#heading--core22)
- [base: core20](#heading--core20)
- [base: core18 | core](#heading--core18)

See [C/C++ applications](c-c-applications.md) for a simple example, or search [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+autotools%22&type=Code) for projects already using the plugin.

> â“˜  This is a *snapcraft* plugin. See [Snapcraft plugins](snapcraft-plugins.md) and [Supported plugins](supported-plugins.md) for further details on how plugins are used.

2. if the *configure* script does not yet exist, it will attempt to run `./autoconf --install`.

- **`autotools-configure-parameters`** (list of strings)
     Configure flags to pass to the build such as those shown by running `./configure --help`

Requires Snapcraft version _7.0+_.
