When [creating snapcraft.yaml](/t/creating-snapcraft-yaml/11666) to build a new snap, its executable components are built from [parts](/t/adding-parts/11473), following the [Snapcraft lifecycle](/t/parts-lifecycle/12231), and selectively made available to the host system.

## Exposing executable components

A snap's executable is exposed to the host system via the top-level `apps` section of *snapcraft.yaml*. Its name needs to correspond with part name responsible for staging the executable within your snap.

For example, here's a complete *snapcraft.yaml* for a fully-functional snap:
```yaml
name: os-release
base: core20
version: '0.2'
summary: Outputs the contents of /etc/os-release
description: Prints the contents of os-release
grade: stable
confinement: strict
apps:
  part-os-release:
    command: bin/os-release.sh
parts:
  part-os-release:
    plugin: dump
    source: .
    organize:
      os-release.sh: bin/
```
The above example creates a snap from the following simple script, called `os-release.sh`, located within the top-level snap of the directory:

```bash
#! /bin/sh
cat /etc/os-release
```
Make sure the above script is executable by running the following command on the build host after creating the script:

```bash
$ chmod +x os-release.sh
```

The `os-release.sh` executable is brought into the snap via `part-os-release`, which is a [part](/t/adding-parts/11473) using the [dump plugin](/t/the-dump-plugin/8007). It then uses `organize` to copy the *os-release.sh* file into the snap's `bin/` directory before the top-level [apps](/t/snapcraft-app-and-service-metadata/8335) section exposes the `bin/os-release.sh` executable to the host system

Services can be managed with a set of additional commands. See [Services and daemons](/t/services-and-daemons/12601) for more information and for further details on other metadata, see [Snapcraft app and service metadata](/t/snapcraft-app-and-service-metadata/8335).

If you need to add user configurable options to your service or daemon, such as which port it should use, see [Adding snap configuration](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/adding-snap-configuration/15246).

See [Tab completion](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/tab-completion-for-snaps/2261) if you wish to add command line tab completion to your snap.


> ℹ  **Interfaces** enable an app  to access system resources. Interfaces that are required for normal operation are specified at snap build-time within the above `app` metadata of a snap’s snapcraft.yaml. See [Adding Interfaces](/t/adding-interfaces/13123) for more details.
