The `make` plugin is useful when building [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)-based parts. Make-based projects will typically include a *Makefile* that drives the build.

This plugin runs 'make' followed by 'make install', except when the `artifacts` keyword is used with _core18_ or _core_.

If your project uses [Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/), take a look at the [autotools](/t/the-autotools-plugin/8616) plugin. For examples, search [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+make%22&type=Code) for projects using the plugin.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources". For more information, see [Snapcraft parts metadata](/t/snapcraft-parts-metadata/8336).

Its features and syntax are dependent on which [base](/t/base-snaps/11198) is being used, as outlined below:

- [base: core22](#heading--core22)
- [base: core20](#heading--core20)
- [base: core18 | core](#heading--core18)

 > â“˜  This is a *snapcraft* plugin. See [Snapcraft plugins](/t/snapcraft-plugins/4284) and [Supported plugins](/t/supported-plugins/8080) for further details on how plugins are used.

This plugin uses the following plugin-specific keywords:

- **`make-parameters`** (list of strings)
  Parameters to pass to the make command.

Use Snapcraft's [override-build](/t/snapcraft-parts-metadata/8336#heading--override-build) functionality to implement the equivalent `makefile`, `artifacts` and `make-install-var` functionality available to _core18_ and _core_ snaps.


Requires Snapcraft version _7.0+_.
