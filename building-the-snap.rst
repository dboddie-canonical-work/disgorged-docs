Building the snap
=================

[quote] **NOTE TO EDITORS**

This topic contributes to a new set of snap documentation. See `Proposed new documentation outline <https://snapcraft.io/docs/proposed-new-documentation-outline-page-deprecated>`__ for further details.

[/quote] Whether you use Linux, Mac, or Windows for your development environment, you can create snaps of your app provided it is able to natively run on Linux.

Once youâ€™ve `set up your project to produce snaps <creating-a-snap.md>`__, you can build your ``.snap`` file: \* `Linux <building-the-snap-on-linux.md>`__ \* `Mac <building-the-snap-on-mac.md>`__ \* `Windows <building-the-snap-on-windows.md>`__

It is also possible to build snaps from `Docker <build-on-docker.md>`__, or by using `remote-build <https://snapcraft.io/docs/remote-build>`__ facilities.
