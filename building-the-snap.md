Whether you use Linux, Mac, or Windows for your development environment, you can create snaps of your app provided it is able to natively run on Linux.

Once you've [set up your project to produce snaps](/t/creating-a-snap/6799), you can build your `.snap` file:
* [Linux](/t/building-the-snap-on-linux/6753)
* [Mac](/t/building-the-snap-on-mac/6751)
* [Windows](/t/building-the-snap-on-windows/6829)

It is also possible to build snaps from [Docker](/t/build-on-docker/4158), or by using [remote-build](https://snapcraft.io/docs/remote-build) facilities.
