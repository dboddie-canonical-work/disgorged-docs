This topic contributes to a new set of snap documentation. See [Proposed new documentation outline](https://snapcraft.io/docs/proposed-new-documentation-outline-page-deprecated) for further details.

Whether you use Linux, Mac, or Windows for your development environment, you can create snaps of your app provided it is able to natively run on Linux.

Once you've [set up your project to produce snaps](creating-a-snap.md), you can build your `.snap` file:
* [Linux](building-the-snap-on-linux.md)
* [Mac](building-the-snap-on-mac.md)
* [Windows](building-the-snap-on-windows.md)

It is also possible to build snaps from [Docker](build-on-docker.md), or by using [remote-build](https://snapcraft.io/docs/remote-build) facilities.
