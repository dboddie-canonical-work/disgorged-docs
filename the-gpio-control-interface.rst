The gpio-control interface

``gpio-control`` allows the control of all aspects of GPIO pins.

This interface can potentially impact the system and other snaps, and allows privileged access to hardware. See `The gpio interface <the-gpio-interface.md>`__ to access a specific pin.

`Auto-connect <interface-management.md#the-gpio-control-interface-heading--auto-connections>`__: no `Super-privileged <super-privileged-interfaces.md>`__: yes

Requires snapd version *2.41+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See `Interface management <interface-management.md>`__ and `Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces.md>`__ for further details on how interfaces are used.
