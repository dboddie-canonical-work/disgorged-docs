The `dm-crypt`  interface enables the following access functions to  [dm-crypt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-crypt.html) encrypted external block storage devices:

- setting up a LUKS partition
- locking and unlocking _dm-crypt_ partitions
- adding key(s) to kernel keyring
- formatting encrypted partition(s) ( creation of fs)
- mounting of encrypted partition(s)

**[Auto-connect](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--auto-connections)**: no
**[Super-privileged](/t/super-privileged-interfaces/34740)**: yes

Often, _dm-crypt_ is statically linked into the kernel (`CONFIG_DM_CRYPT=y`). This is expected when working with custom kernels on projects where disk encryption is required.
