The `ptp` interface allows access to the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [Hardware Clock subsystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ptp/ptp.txt) in the Linux kernel, enabling the clock to be synced to sub-100 nanoseconds. 
 
This interface is primarily intended to be used with [Ubuntu Core](/t/glossary/14612#heading--ubuntu-core).
