**The 'version-script' keyword has been replaced by `snapcraftctl set-version'**

_introduced in snapcraft 2.41_

The `version-script` keyword could be used to define a command to run from the working directory of the source tree root that printed a version string to the standard output.

This functionality has been replaced by the `snapcraftctl set-version` part scriptlet.
