Snapcraft How-to guides
=======================

[quote] **NOTE TO EDITORS**

This topic is currently under construction as we start to migrate our current documentation to use the `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__ framework.

See `Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation <https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation>`__ for more details.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with *snapcraft* (after following a tutorial, for example), our *How-to* guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications.

Our How-to guides help you achieve an end result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Alternatively, our tutorials section contain step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Snapcraft is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Snapcraft and building your first snap.

Take a look at our *Reference section* when you need to know which options can be used, what functions the API supports, which rescue modes are supported and the contents of *gadget.yaml*,

Finally, for a better understanding of how Snapcraft works, and how it can be used and configured, our *Explanation* section enable you to expand your knowledge and become better at building snaps with Snapcraft.
