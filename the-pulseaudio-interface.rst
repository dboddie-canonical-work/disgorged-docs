The pulseaudio interface
========================

   ⚠ As of snapd 2.41, this interface is deprecated and the ```audio-playback`` <the-audio-playback-interface.md>`__ and ```audio-record`` <the-audio-record-interface.md>`__ interfaces should be used instead. They provide access to PulseAudio and will provide access to other sound servers in the future.

``pulseaudio`` enables access to the PulseAudio sound server for sound playback and recording.

**Auto-connect**: no

*Note: The*\ ```audio-playback`` <the-audio-playback-interface.md>`__\ *interface is auto-connected.*

   ⓘ This is a snap interface. See `Interface management <interface-management.md>`__ and `Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces.md>`__ for further details on how interfaces are used.
