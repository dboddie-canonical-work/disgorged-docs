# Snapcraft Extensions

Snapcraft extensions enable snap developers to easily incorporate a set of common requirements into a snap.

These requirements can include build and staging packages, plugs and interfaces, file layouts and environments, and whatever other [snapcraft.yaml](/t/the-snapcraft-format/8337) elements may be required to build a functioning system.

**For a full list of supported extensions, see [Supported extensions](/t/supported-extensions/20521).**

A snap developer creating a GTK 3 application snap, for example, can use the `gnome-3-28` extension to expose the GTK 3 libraries to a snap at build and runtime without the snap developer needing specific deep knowledge about GTK 3. There are extensions for building robotics (ROS 2) applications too, including the [ROS2 Humble Extension](/t/the-ros-2-humble-extension/30809).

Extensions help:
- avoid repetitive tasks in the snap building process
- obviate the need for in-depth knowledge of the target software stack
- create a standard template for common application requirements
- reduce the testing and security burden, as they're tested and updated independently

> â“˜  For more details on the snap building process, see [Creating a snap](/t/creating-a-snap/6799).

## Using Extensions

To use an extension, the [app](/t/snapcraft-app-and-service-metadata/8335#heading--extension) metadata section of the snap's [snapcraft.yaml](/t/the-snapcraft-format/8337) needs include the `extensions` definition. The following snippet, for example, shows how the [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/d36cf98aa85f24ceefd07521b3d16b9edd2abcb7/taskcluster/docker/firefox-snap/firefox.snapcraft.yaml.in#L15) snap uses the `gnome-3-34` extension to add Gnome desktop support:

```bash
apps:
  firefox:
    command: firefox
    command-chain: [tmpdir]
    desktop: distribution/firefox.desktop
    extensions: [gnome-3-34]
[...]
```

All extensions are included with Snapcraft and can be listed with the following command:

```bash
$ snapcraft extensions
Extension name    Supported bases
----------------  -----------------
gnome-3-28        core18
gnome-3-38        core20
kde-neon          core18, core20
[...]
```

See [Supported Extensions](/t/supported-extensions/20521) for the full list of extensions.

Further information about any specific extension can be obtained by typing `snapcraft extension` followed by the extension name:

```shell
$ snapcraft extension gnome-3-28
This extension eases creation of snaps that integrate with GNOME 3.28
...
```

Extensions modify the `snapcraft.yaml` definition before a build. You can use the `expand-extensions` command from your project's root directory to see how the `snapcraft.yaml` file will look with the extensions applied.

```shell
$ snapcraft expand-extensions
name: foliate
...

  /usr/lib/$SNAPCRAFT_ARCH_TRIPLET/webkit2gtk-4.0:
    bind: $SNAP/gnome-platform/usr/lib/$SNAPCRAFT_ARCH_TRIPLET/webkit2gtk-4.0
