This version is included in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) but also in the stable channel of the Snap Store, so probably it already landed on your system as an auto update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnapping an application with print functionality is easy, do not get turned away by the rather complicated inner workings. Especially your Snap will always talk with the CUPS Snap for all things printing, never with the system’s cupsd (it auto-installs the CUPS Snap as a dependency). This is for security. If the user has a conventional CUPS installation, the CUPS Snap works as a firewall only passing through the non-administrative requests and blocking the administrative ones and if the user uses the CUPS Snap as standard printing environment the CUPS Snap manages this by itself (see my next post here).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, you start your snapping the same way as you are used to for applications without print functionality. Read about this part elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, in \u003ccode\u003esnapcraft.yaml\u003c/code\u003e let each app with print functionality plug the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eapps:\n  my-printing-application:\n    command: my-printing-app\n    plugs:\n      - cups\n      - network\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eapps:\n  lp:\n    command: usr/bin/lp\n    plugs: [network, home, cups]\n  lpstat:\n    command: usr/bin/lpstat\n    plugs: [network, avahi-observe, cups]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird, add this line to \u003ccode\u003esnapcraft.yaml\u003c/code\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e# We need snapd 2.55 or later to have the needed support for the\n# `cups` interface in snapd\nassumes: [snapd2.55]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not put this into any section, put it right after the header part for example. Simply copy and paste this blob of lines as you see it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese lines make your Snap require at least version 2.55 of snapd, as older versions do not have the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface. I assume that this triggers an auto-update of snapd if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForth, add the placeholder content interface to trigger the auto-installation of the CUPS Snap. Simply add the following lines to \u003ccode\u003esnapcraft.yaml\u003c/code\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e# this is not used or needed for anything other than to trigger automatic\n# installation of the cups snap via \"default-provider: cups\"\nplugs:\n  foo-install-cups:\n    interface: content\n    content: foo\n    default-provider: cups\n    target: $SNAP_DATA/foo\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not put this into any section, too, put it again right after the header part for example. Simply copy and paste the whole blob of lines as you see it here. Nothing needs to get adapted to your particular Snap, nor you have to create any directories in your Snap for that to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Having to add these lines is only a temporary workaround. The \u003ccode\u003edefault-provider\u003c/code\u003e functionality is planned to be added to the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface in snapd in the coming months. When this has taken place, all what is needed to use the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface is plugging \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e as described in the second step here and the \u003ccode\u003eassumes: [snapd2.55]\u003c/code\u003e line of the third step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifth, build your Snap as you are used to, test it, and upload it into the Snap Store using your habitual method. If a user installs it, the CUPS Snap gets auto-installed and the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface auto-connected and printing out of the Snap “just works”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO NOT plug both \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e in the same Snap. This can mess up things, especially as CUPS’ Snap mediation (mechanism to block administrative tasks) works “per-Snap” and not “per-application-in-the-Snap”, meaning that if one of the apps in the Snap plugs \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e CUPS assumes the whole Snap plugging \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e and allows all apps in the Snap to do administrative operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/snapcore/test-snapd-cups-consumer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ecomplete example here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks a lot to my colleagues in the Desktop and snapd teams of Canonical for the great collaboration and team work to get the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface designed and implemented: Michael Vogt, Ian Johnson, James Henstridge, Samuele Pedroni, Alex Murray, Alberto Mardegan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd also thanks to Michael Sweet for the helping with the smooth integration of the Snap mediation into the CUPS code.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-04-25T15:34:59.758Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":538,"reads":38,"readers_count":37,"score":2762.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":29702,"topic_slug":"new-interface-cups-for-all-snaps-which-print","display_username":"Till Kamppeter","primary_group_name":null,"primary_group_flair_url":null,"primary_group_flair_bg_color":null,"primary_group_flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://github.com/snapcore/test-snapd-cups-consumer","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":26},{"url":"http://www.openprinting.org/","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":6},{"url":"https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/cups-interface-merged-into-snapd-additional-steps-to-complete/28653/35","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"\"cups\" interface merged into snapd - Additional steps to complete","clicks":0},{"url":"https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/the-cups-interface/29873","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"The \"cups\" Interface","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":6}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":644,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":108535,"name":"Till Kamppeter","username":"till.kamppeter","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/forum.snapcraft.io/till.kamppeter/{size}/3687_2.png","created_at":"2022-04-25T12:03:54.156Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor the Technically Interested: How the “\u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e” snapd Interface Actually Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e This post describes the rather complex inner workings of the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface in snapd. As a snapper you do not need to read this, all instructions you need are in my first post, above. You can simply skip to the further news and discussion in the following posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally posted in the \u003ca href=\"https://openprinting.github.io/OpenPrinting-News-March-2022/#cups-snap-and-snapd-printing-interface\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003eOpenPrinting News March 2022\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnaps are file systems in isolated sandboxes. A Snap is not able to access the file system of another Snap (like the CUPS Snap for example) nor it is able to access the file system of the host system (like for example the Unix socket of a classically installed CUPS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor exceptions from this isolation there are interfaces. They have well-defined permissions what a Snap can access in the outside world. Snaps of user applications, like LibreOffice, Darktable, … have so-called “plugs”: \u003ccode\u003enetwork\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eavahi-observer\u003c/code\u003e, …, and \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e. These plugs are connected (“plugged”) to so-called “slots”, most of the host system but some also of other Snaps (usually servers/system daemons in a Snap, like the CUPS Snap).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe packager of a Snap can decide which interfaces the packaged application plugs and so he can have maximum security without losing functionality of the application. He uploads the Snap to the Snap Store and when a user installs it on his system, the interfaces usually get auto-connected and the user can use the application without hassle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there are some interfaces through which you can do operations which are dangerous for the system. One of them for example is the \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e interface, which snapd provided already from the beginning on and plugging it (to the system) allows your Snap not only to list the available printers and to print on them, but also to do any administrative tasks (creating and modifying queues, changing cupsd configuration, seeing and deleting other user’s jobs, …) on the system’s classically installed (RPM, DEB, …) CUPS. In classic systems you control this via the “lpadmin” group, but in the Snap world you do not have any system groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid that arbitrary developers can upload Snaps to the Snap Store which plug such “dangerous” interfaces and abuse them, compromising the system’s security, only selected (not “dangerous”) interfaces get auto-connected when installing from the Snap Store, other interfaces need to get connected manually by the user (requires “root” access to the system), or the developer of the Snap has to request a special permission for auto-connection by the Snap Store team (they manage the list of which interfaces are “dangerous” or not). The Snap Store team reviews the application and at least 2 members have to be in favor of the auto-connection for it to get improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow when I started to get printing into the Snap world several years ago, snapping CUPS but also looking into how snapped applications can print, I found out that the only way to print out of a Snap was through the “dangerous” \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e interface. The snapper of an application had to plug this interface and request special permission from the Snap Store for the interface’s auto-connection on the user’s machines, or the user had to connect it manually, not really having printing “just work”. In addition, this could lead up to very many special permissions from the Snap Store team and raise the probability that a developer abuses his permission by modifying his application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I started developing, together with the snapd developer team, the new \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface. All the development was accompanied by the \u003ca href=\"https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/handling-of-the-cups-plug-by-snapd-especially-auto-connection/\"\u003esnapcraft.io forum thread of the initial feature request\u003c/a\u003e which I started \u003cstrong\u003eexactly\u003c/strong\u003e one year ago, on March 18, 2021. There were two pull requests on the snapd code, the first got dropped and the second got merged around half a year after getting initially posted. After the merge, on February 7, 2022, I marked this thread as solved and started a \u003ca href=\"https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/cups-interface-merged-into-snapd-additional-steps-to-complete/\"\u003esecond thread\u003c/a\u003e for the finalization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let us see how this interface works:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn application with print functionality (like LibreOffice, Darktable, gedit, …) plugs the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface. In contrary to \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e the slot is not in the host system, but in the CUPS Snap, always the CUPS Snap, even if the user uses a classically installed (RPM, DEB, source, …) CUPS on his system. This means that the CUPS Snap gets auto-installed (like a package dependency) during the installation of the application Snap when it is not already on the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application Snap then mounts the CUPS Snap’s \u003ccode\u003e/var/snap/cups/common/run\u003c/code\u003e directory into its own file system’s \u003ccode\u003e/var/cups\u003c/code\u003e directory and has this way access to the Unix socket of the CUPS Snap’s CUPS daemon, as \u003ccode\u003e/var/cups/cups.sock\u003c/code\u003e. This interaction between the two Snaps is part of the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface. In addition, the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface sets the \u003ccode\u003eCUPS_SERVER\u003c/code\u003e environment variable in the application Snap’s sandbox to \u003ccode\u003e/var/cups/cups.sock\u003c/code\u003e so that the application uses the CUPS Snap’s CUPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is no classically installed CUPS on the system, the CUPS Snap is running in its standalone mode and is the system’s print environment, also for non-snapped, classically installed applications (for which it then creates a second socket as the usual \u003ccode\u003e/run/cups/cups.sock\u003c/code\u003e). So both the snapped and the unsnapped applications print happily via the snapped CUPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if there is a classic installation of CUPS on the user’s system, with lots of thoroughly manually created queues and even proprietary printer drivers which we cannot migrate into a CUPS-Snap-based system? In this case the CUPS Snap sees that there is a classic CUPS configuration and automatically starts in its proxy mode. This means the CUPS Snap’s CUPS daemon is a proxy for the system’s CUPS daemon. The CUPS Snap runs a helper daemon (named \u003ccode\u003ecups-proxyd\u003c/code\u003e) along with its CUPS daemon and \u003ccode\u003ecups-proxyd\u003c/code\u003e observes the system’s CUPS and clones all its queues, as filterless pass-through queues but with the same PPD files as the original queues, to have the same options and printer properties. Every change on the system’s classically installed CUPS is immediately synced into the Snap’s CUPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why that complicated for the most common situation of having a classically installed CUPS on the system? Why running two CUPS daemons on one simple desktop machine? The Snap’s CUPS daemon in this configuration is a firewall for the system’s CUPS daemon, it protects it against administrative requests of the snapped application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning we told that the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface blocks administrative requests, but we did not tell how. snapd does not understand IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) and so it cannot filter out the unwished requests from the communication between the application and the CUPS daemon. So who is best for understanding IPP? CUPS! So I have implemented the filtering in the CUPS daemon, the so-called Snap mediation. The CUPS daemon, if it is new enough, 2.4.x in general, also some 2.3.x in case of Debian or Ubuntu packages, checks on each administrative inquiry it receives whether it is from a confined Snap (only these you can upload into the Snap Store without special permission). If so, it checks whether the client Snap plugs \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e and only then it accepts the request. Requests from unsnapped clients or classic Snaps are not blocked. As we are explaining the mechanisms of the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface, our client plugs \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e and not \u003ccode\u003ecups-control\u003c/code\u003e and so its administrative requests get rejected and our CUPS is safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CUPS Snap only exists with a Snap-mediating CUPS, at least at the time of launch of the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface with snapd 2.55, but actually already for many months, since I implemented the Snap mediation. This way with the \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e interface forcing the application’s CUPS communication through the Snap’s CUPS we are for sure blocking the unwished requests. If we let the snapped application communicate directly with the system’s CUPS, we cannot be sure that the administrative requests are blocked, as classically installed CUPS daemons can be too old or the package maintainer could have opted for building CUPS without Snap mediation. We need to keep in mind that Snaps are distribution-independent packages, and each distribution’s classic CUPS packages can be different. Therefore we need the CUPS Snap as proxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way we can safely install application Snaps. They plug \u003ccode\u003ecups\u003c/code\u003e and therefore can print but not mess up CUPS, whatever CUPS the user prefers to use.
