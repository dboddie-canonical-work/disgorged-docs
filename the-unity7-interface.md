# The unity7 interface

`unity7` allows interacting with Unity 7 services.

**Auto-connect**: yes
**Transitional**: yes

This interface grants privileged access to the user's session because the Unity 7 environment does not prevent eavesdropping or apps interfering with one another.

See [The desktop interfaces](/t/the-desktop-interfaces/2042) for further details.

**Condition to Connect**: If your snap has a graphical user interface and is expected to be launched on Unity desktop environment(the default DE on Ubuntu 16.04), you *should* connect this interface.

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](/t/interface-management/6154) and [Supported interfaces](/t/supported-interfaces/7744) for further details on how interfaces are used.
