`bluez` enables access to the bluez Bluetooth service.

The plug is the client and the slot provides access to the bluez (Bluetooth) service. Connecting the two allows a client to access devices registered by the bluez service through the slot.

For example, a game with a _bluez_ plug could connect to the system's _bluez_ slot to access a Bluetooth game controller.
