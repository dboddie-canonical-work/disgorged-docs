# The qmake plugin

The `qmake` plugin is useful when building [qmake](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html)-based parts.

Qmake-based projects typically use [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), although not always, and are built using *.pro* files.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for [sources](snapcraft-parts-metadata.md#the-qmake-plugin-heading--source). For more information, see [Snapcraft parts metadata](snapcraft-parts-metadata.md).

Additional features and syntax are dependent on which [base](base-snaps.md) is being used, as outlined below:

- [base: core20](#the-qmake-plugin-heading--core20)
- [base: core18 | core](#the-qmake-plugin-heading--core18)

For examples, search [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+qmake%22&type=Code) for projects already using the plugin.

> â“˜  This is a *snapcraft* plugin. See [Snapcraft plugins](snapcraft-plugins.md) and [Supported plugins](supported-plugins.md) for further details on how plugins are used.
