# Creating a snap

You can create snaps from apps you've already built and zipped, or from your preferred programming language or framework.

For a brief overview of the snap creation process, including how to install *snapcraft* and how it's used, see [Snapcraft overview](snapcraft-overview.md).

The following is an outline of the typical snap build process, which you can step through to create your snap:

1. [Create a checklist](snapcraft-checklist.md)
   Better understand your snap's requirements.
1. [Create a snapcraft.yaml file](creating-snapcraft-yaml.md)
   Describes your snap's build dependencies and run-time requirements
1. [Add interfaces to your snap](adding-interfaces.md)
    Share system resources with your snap, and from one snap to another
1. [Publish and share](https://snapcraft.io/docs/using-the-snap-store)
    Put your snap on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store) to reach an audience of millions
