This extension helps you snap ROS 2 applications for the [Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases/Release-Humble-Hawksbill.html) distribution.

> :information_source: This extension requires Snapcraft 7.3+.

## How to use it

Add `extensions: [ ros2-humble ]` to the application definition in your `snapcraft.yaml` file. See the [ROS 2 applications](https://snapcraft.io/docs/ros2-applications#heading--core22) documentation page for a complete tutorial on how to use this extension.

```yaml
    ...
apps:
  colcon-ros2-humble-rlcpp-hello:
    command: opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 run colcon_ros2_rlcpp_hello colcon_ros2_rlcpp_hello
    extensions: [ros2-humble]
    ...
```

## What it does for the build-time environment

* Adds [ROS 2 APT package repository](http://repo.ros2.org/ubuntu/main) build-time configuration for the snap, installing the necessary GPG key.
* Adds the following `build-packages`:  
  * ros-humble-ros-environment
  * ros-humble-ros-workspace
  * ros-humble-ament-index-cpp
  * ros-humble-ament-index-python
* Defines the `build-environment`:
  * `ROS_VERSION = 2`
  * `ROS_DISTRO = humble`

## What it does for the run-time environment

* Initializes runtime environment required by ROS 2 before launching the application, similar to sourcing the typical ROS 2 `local_setup.bash`.
