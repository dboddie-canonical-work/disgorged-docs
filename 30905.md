 **NOTE TO EDITORS** 

This topic is currently under construction as we start to migrate our current documentation to use the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework.

See [ Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation](https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation) for more details.

Snapcraft **builds**, **packages** and **publishes** snaps. It's available for **Ubuntu**, many **other Linux distributions**, and **macOS**, and runs from the command line.

With Snapcraft, developers can use platform-specific **plugins** and **extensions** to **streamline** and **simplify** the build process. Snaps can then be **tested and shared locally** before being published to the global [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store) within channels, tracks and branches to **finely control releases**.

Snapcraft does all of this within a self-launched [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/) or [Multipass](https://multipass.run/docs) **container**, or **natively** from your own environment, and includes **linting, debug and staging functions** to help solve problems. You can also incorporate Snapcraft package building into your CI systems, and **build snaps remotely** from either **GitHub** or our **Launchpad** build farm.

From desktop applications, servers and cloud deployments, to embedded devices and IoT. From a single user to hundreds of thousands of users, Snapcraft can help.
