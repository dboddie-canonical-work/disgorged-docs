**The 'prepare' keyword has been replaced by 'override-build'**

_introduced in snapcraft 2.41_

The `prepare` scriptlet was originally introduced as a way to "prepare" for a build. However, as part of an effort to add support for Snapcraft to have this for _all_ lifecycle steps (i.e. not just build), a new scriptlet has been added that encompasses this functionality called `override-build`. 

>  â“˜  It's also possible to replace `prepare` with [`override-pull`](/t/scriptlets/4892), depending on your requirements.

`override-build` allows you to override the default `build` step with your own logic, from which you can call `snapcraftctl build` to run the default `build` step.

Let's say you currently had a `prepare` scriptlet that looked like this:

```
prepare: |
  echo "This runs before build!"
```

To get equivalent functionality with the `override-build` scriptlet, try this:

```
override-build: |
  echo "This runs before build!"
  snapcraftctl build
```
