The main building blocks of a snap are *parts*. They are used to declare pieces of code that will be pulled into your snap package. The *parts* keys and values in [snapcraft.yaml](/t/the-snapcraft-format/8337) detail how parts are configured and built by the *snapcraft* command.

> See [Snapcraft top-level metadata](/t/snapcraft-top-level-metadata/8334) and [Snapcraft apps and services metadata](/t/snapcraft-app-and-service-metadata/8335) for details on how apps and parts are configured within *snapcraft.yaml*.


### parts

Type: `dict`

A set of independent building blocks.

These independent building blocks are known as *parts*, and consist of either code or pre-built packages.


### parts.\<part-name\>

Type: `dict`

The name of the part building block.

`<part-name`> represents the specific name of a building block which can be then referenced by the command-line tool (i.e. `snapcraft`).


## Keys for parts

The following are keys that can be used within **parts.<part-name>** (for example, `parts.<part-name>.plugin`):

### after

Type: `list[string]` 

Ensures that all the \<part-names\> listed in `after` are staged before this part begins its [lifecycle](/t/parts-lifecycle/12231#heading--steps).

<h3 id='heading--build-attributes'>build-attributes<sup><a href='#heading--build-attributes'>⚓</a></sup></h3>

Type: `enum`

A list of named attributes to modify the behaviour of plugins. 

Supported attributes:

* `debug`: Plugins that support the concept of build types build in Release mode by default. Setting the 'debug' attribute requests that they instead build in debug mode.
* `keep-execstack`: Do not remove the "executable stack" bit from ELF files.
* `no-patchelf`: Do not patch ELF files, even when Snapcraft believes it is required (e.g. for classic snaps)
* `enable-patchelf`: Do patch ELF files, even when Snapcraft does not believe it's required (e.g. for strict snaps)
* `no-install`: Do not run the install target provided by the plugin's build system.</br> *(Only supported by the [kbuild plugin](/t/the-kbuild-plugin/8633))*

For more information, refer to the output of `snapcraft help plugins`.

<h3 id='heading--build-environment'>build-environment<sup><a href='#heading--build-environment'>⚓</a></sup></h3>

```

### build-packages

Type: `list[string]` 

A list of packages required to build a snap.

Packages are installed using the host's package manager, such as `apt` or `dnf`, and are required for \<part-name\> to build correctly. This entry supports additional syntax, for more information refer to [Advanced grammar](/t/snapcraft-advanced-grammar/8349).

See [Using external metadata](/t/using-external-metadata/4642) for more details.


### plugin

Type: `string` 

The plugin to drive the build process. 

Every part drives its build through a plugin, this entry declares the plugin that will drive the build process for `<part-name>`. Refer to [snapcraft plugins](/t/snapcraft-plugins/4284) for more information on the available plugins and the specific attributes they add to the `parts.<part-name>.` namespace. 


### prepare (deprecated)

Type:  `multiline string`

Runs a script before the plugin's [build](/t/parts-lifecycle/12231#heading--steps) step.

The script is run before the build step defined for `parts.<part-name>.plugin` starts. The working directory is the base build directory for the given part. The defined script is run with `/bin/sh` and `set -e`.  A set of [Environment Variables](/t/environment-variables/7983) will be available to the script. 

> :warning: The release of [Snapcraft 3.0](/t/release-notes-snapcraft-3-0/10704) made this key obsolete. Use [`override-build`](#heading--override-build) instead.


### prime

Type: `list[string]` 

A list of files from \<part-name\> to [prime](/t/parts-lifecycle/12231#heading--steps).

Rules applying to the list here are the same as those of filesets. Referencing of fileset keys is done with a `$` prefixing the fileset key, which will expand with the value of such key.

Type: `string` 

A URL or path to a source tree to build. 

This can be a local path or remote and can refer to a directory tree, a compressed archive, or a revision control repository. This entry supports additional syntax, for more information refer to [Advanced grammar](/t/snapcraft-advanced-grammar/8349) 


### source-branch

Type: `string` 

Work on a specific branch for source repositories under version control. 


### source-checksum

Type: `string`

Used when `source` represents a file.

### source-commit

Type: `string` 

Work on a specific commit for source repositories under version control. 


### source-depth

Type: `integer`

Depth of history for sources using version control. 

Source repositories under version control are cloned or checked out with full history. Specifying a depth will truncate the history to the specified number of commits.


### source-subdir

Type: `string` 

A path within the `source` to set as the working directory when building. The build will _not_ be able to access files outside of this location, such as one level up.

### source-submodules

Type: `dict`

Configure which submodules to fetch from the source tree in snapcraft.yaml with `source-submodules: <list-of-submodules>`

When **source-submodules** is defined, only the listed submodules are fetched:

```yaml
parts:
  git-test:
    plugin: dump
    source-type: git
    source: git@github.com...
    source-submodules:
      - submodule_1
      - dir1/submodule_2
```

If **source-submodules** is defined and the list is empty, no submodules are fetched:

```yaml
parts:
  git-test:
    plugin: dump
    source-type: git
    source: git@github.com...
    source-submodules: []

Rules applying to the list here are the same as those of filesets. Referencing of fileset keys is done with a `$` prefixing the fileset key, which will expand with the value of such key. 


### stage-packages

Type: `list[string]`

A list of packages required at runtime by a snap.

Packages are required by \<part-name\> to run. They are fetched using the host's package manager, such as `apt` or `dnf`, and are unpacked into the snap being built. This entry supports additional syntax, for more information refer to [Advanced grammar](/t/snapcraft-advanced-grammar/8349). 

Example: `[python-zope.interface, python-bcrypt]`


### stage-snaps

Type: `list[string]`
