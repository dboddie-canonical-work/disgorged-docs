# The gpio-control interface

`gpio-control` allows the control of all aspects of GPIO pins.

This interface can potentially impact the system and other snaps, and allows privileged access to hardware. See [The gpio interface](/t/the-gpio-interface/7829) to access a specific pin.

**[Auto-connect](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--auto-connections)**: no</br>
**[Super-privileged](/t/super-privileged-interfaces/34740)**: yes</br>

Requires snapd version _2.41+_.

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](/t/interface-management/6154) and [Supported interfaces](/t/supported-interfaces/7744) for further details on how interfaces are used.
