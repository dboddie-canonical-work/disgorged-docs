# The gpio-control interface

`gpio-control` allows the control of all aspects of GPIO pins.

This interface can potentially impact the system and other snaps, and allows privileged access to hardware. See [The gpio interface](the-gpio-interface.md) to access a specific pin.

**[Auto-connect](interface-management.md#heading--auto-connections)**: no</br>
**[Super-privileged](super-privileged-interfaces.md)**: yes</br>

Requires snapd version _2.41+_.

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](interface-management.md) and [Supported interfaces](supported-interfaces.md) for further details on how interfaces are used.
