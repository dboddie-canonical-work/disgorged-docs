The cmake plugin
================

The ``cmake`` plugin is useful for building `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__-based parts. This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for `sources <snapcraft-parts-metadata.md#the-cmake-plugin-heading--source>`__. For more information, see :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>`.

This plugin also supports options from the :ref:`make <the-make-plugin>` plugin.

A *cmake* project will typically include a *CMakeLists.txt* file to drive the build, and the plugin requires that *CMakeLists.txt* exists within the root of the source tree.

Plugin-specific features and syntax are dependent on which :ref:`base <base-snaps>` is being used, as outlined below:

-  `base: core22 <#the-cmake-plugin-heading--core22>`__
-  `base: core20 <#the-cmake-plugin-heading--core20>`__
-  `base: core18 \| core <#the-cmake-plugin-heading--core18>`__

For a simple example, see :ref:`MOOS applications <moos-applications>`, or search `GitHub <https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+cmake%22&type=Code>`__ for projects already using the plugin.

   â“˜ This is a *snapcraft* plugin. See :ref:`Snapcraft plugins <snapcraft-plugins>` and :ref:`Supported plugins <supported-plugins>` for further details on how plugins are used.

-  **``cmake-generator``** (string, default: *Unix Makefiles*) Determine what native build system is to be used. Can be either ``Ninja`` or ``Unix Makefiles`` (default).
-  **``cmake-parameters``** (list of strings) Configure flags to pass to the build using the common *cmake* semantics.

Note that Snapcraft does not specify cmake parameters by default. A common parameter for parts using the cmake plugin is ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr`` - this prevents installation to the default directory of ``/usr/local``. For example:

::

   parts:
     hello:
       plugin: cmake
       cmake-parameters:
         - -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
       ....

Requires Snapcraft version *7.0+*.
