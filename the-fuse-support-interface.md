# The fuse-support interface

`fuse-support` allows access to FUSE filesystems.

**Auto-connect**: no
**NOTE**:
* Unprivileged fuse mounts(i.e. mounting directory outside of the snap-specific writable directories) [are NOT supported by this interface](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/pull/1598#issuecomment-239952977)
* Mountpoint can only exist in snap-specific writable directories:
    * `SNAP_USER_{DATA,COMMON}`
    * `SNAP_{DATA,COMMON}`

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](/t/interface-management/6154) and [Supported interfaces](/t/supported-interfaces/7744) for further details on how interfaces are used.
