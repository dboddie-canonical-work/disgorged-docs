# The gpio-memory-control interface

`gpio-memory-control` allows write access to all GPIO memory, via `/dev/gpiomem`. This interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to all GPIO devices.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version _2.24+_.

> â“˜  This is a snap interface. See [Interface management](/t/interface-management/6154) and [Supported interfaces](/t/supported-interfaces/7744) for further details on how interfaces are used.
