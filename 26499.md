The `gconf`  interface  allows access to any item from the legacy [GConf configuration system](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/gconf) for the current user, typically used by old GNOME desktop libraries and applications.

This interface needs to be manually connected because _gconf_ is a global database for GNOME desktop and application settings and offers no application isolation.

**Auto-connect**: no

Modern applications should use dconf/gsettings instead and this interface is provided for old codebases that cannot be migrated.
