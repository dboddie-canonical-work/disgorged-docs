The `catkin_tools` build plugin is useful when building [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) parts.

This plugin depends on the [catkin](/t/the-catkin-plugin/8644) plugin. The catkin plugin runs the configuration process that allows *catkin_tools* to run. 

This plugin uses the same keywords and configurations as the *catkin* plugin. The difference is the installation of *catkin_tools* and, consequently, using *catkin_tools* to build.

For examples, search [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+catkin-tools%22&type=Code) for projects already using the plugin.


Plugin-specific features and syntax are dependent on which [base](/t/base-snaps/11198) is being used, as outlined below:

- [base: core20](#heading--core20)
- [base: core18 | core](#heading--core18)

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources". For more information, see [Snapcraft parts metadata](/t/snapcraft-parts-metadata/8336).

## <h3 id='heading--core20'>base: core20</h3>

For core20, this plugin is designed to work with the [ROS 1 Noetic Extension](/t/the-ros-1-noetic-extension/20070).  If not using this extension, it is required to set the `ROS_DISTRO` environment variable to `noetic` using `build-environment`.

This plugin enables the following plugin-specific keywords on core20:

- **`catkin-tools-packages`** (list of strings)
List of catkin packages to build. If not specified, all packages in the
workspace will be built. If set to an empty list (`[]`), no packages will
be built, which could be useful if you only want ROS debs in the snap.

- **`catkin-tools-cmake-args`** (list of strings)
Arguments to pass to cmake projects.

## <h3 id='heading--core18'>base: core|core18</h3>

This plugin enables core|core18 properties of the [catkin plugin](/t/the-catkin-plugin/8644#heading--core18).
