# The i2c interface

`i2c` provides access to a specific I2C controller. This interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to hardware devices.

**Auto-Connect**: no
**Attributes**:
 * `path` (slot): path to i2c device node e.g. `/dev/i2c-0`

[Hardware IO interfaces](/t/hardware-io-interfaces/35421) covers some general considerations common to these kinds of devices.

To use a i2c device, the snap developer must add `plugs: [ i2c ]` to a snap's [snapcraft.yaml](/t/the-snapcraft-format/8337). The snap user can then access a specific i2c device with an [interface connection](/t/interface-management/6154#heading--manual-connections).

Use  `snap interface i2c` to see which i2c devices are available on the system:

```bash
$ snap interface i2c
name:    i2c
summary: allows access to specific I2C controller
slots:
  - pi:i2c-0
  - pi:i2c-1
  - pi:i2c-2
```

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via the path specified by the connected slot.
