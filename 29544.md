A branch is an optional finer subdivision of a [channel](/t/channels/551) which allows for the creation of a temporary and short-lived sequence of snaps. They're typically used by snap developers to push fixes or temporary experimental builds on-demand.

Branch names convey their purpose, such as `fix-for-bug123`, but the name isnâ€™t exposed in the normal way, such as with `snap info`. Instead, they can only be installed by someone who knows the branch name, and this is usually only shared by the snap developer to test a specific fix or release.

After 30 days with no further updates, a branch will be closed automatically. The replacement snap will then be chosen from the next most conservative risk-level of the same track. For example, *beta/fix-for-bug123* will fall back to *beta* after the *fix-for-bug123* branch is closed.

<h2 id='heading--creating'>Creating a branch</h2>

To publish a built and tested snap to a new branch, the snap developer can use the same _snapcraft upload_ process used to publish the snap, but with a full [channel description](/t/channels/551) that includes track, risk-level and a new arbitrary branch name:

```bash
snapcraft upload <snap-name.snap> --release=<track>/<risk>/<branch>
```
The branch name cannot contain "`_`" or "`/`" character.

See [Releasing your app](/t/releasing-your-app/6795) for more general details on publishing a snap.

Many snaps will have only a _latest_ track, while others may use different tracks for each supported release, such as [Node.js](https://snapcraft.io/node) or separate tracks for stable and insider builds, such as [Skype](https://snapcraft.io/skype). These details can be retrieved with the `snap info` command:

```bash
$ snap info qvge
name:      qvge
[...]
channels:
  latest/stable:    0.6.0-1 2021-08-28  (45) 103MB -
  latest/candidate: 0.6.1   2021-11-18  (81) 101MB -
  latest/beta:      0.6.1   2021-11-18  (81) 101MB -
  latest/edge:      0.6.3   2022-02-28 (225) 101MB -
```

The above example shows a snap with only a _latest_ track. To publish a locally built snap to its _latest/beta_ channel with a new branch called `fix-test-062`, you would run the following command:

```bash
$ snapcraft upload qvge_0.6.2_amd64.snap --release=latest/beta/fix-test-062
Preparing to upload 'qvge_0.6.2_amd64.snap'.
After uploading, the resulting snap revision will be released to 'latest/beta/fix-test-062' when it passes the Snap Store review.

                 beta               0.6.1      81
                 edge               0.6.3      225

```

The above shows that the new branch now exists under the latest track, beta branch. It can be confirmed by the snap developer with the `snapcraft status` command, but the branch will not appear in the output to `snap info`:

```bash
$ snapcraft status qvge

<h2 id='heading--installing'>Installing a snap from a branch</h2>

To install a snap from a branch, the user needs to know its name. This is typically shared by the developer, either through whatever issue tracking system might be used by the project, or shared informally via a forum post or message.

When you know the branch name, the snap can be installed with the `snap install <snap-name> --channel` command, followed by the full channel description. To install a snap called _qvge_ from its `beta/fix-test-062` branch, for instance, you'd type the following:

```bash
$ snap install qvge --channel beta/fix-test-062
qvge (beta/fix-test-062) 0.6.2 installed
```

If the snap is already installed, replace **install** with **refresh**.

After 30 days with no further updates, a branch will be closed automatically. The replacement snap will then be chosen from the next most conservative risk-level of the same track. For example, _beta/fix-test-061_ will fall back to whatever snap is provided by _beta_ after the fix-test-061 branch is closed.

<h2 id='heading--promote'>Promoting a snap from a branch</h2>

If a snap in a branch proves stable and fixes whatever issue necessitated the branch release, it can be promoted to another channel just like any other snap.

A branch is visible on a snap's 'Release' page in the [Snap Store web UI](https://snapcraft.io/snaps), from where it can be promoted to a different channel just like any other release:

![image|690x367](upload://zrS2lrDGJQNE2giV4bXrnkrQxMr.png) 

A snap from a branch can also be promoted to another channel using _snapcraft_ on the command line:

```bash
$ snapcraft release qvge 230 beta
Track    Arch    Channel            Version    Revision    Expires at
latest   amd64   stable             0.6.0-1    45
                 candidate          0.6.1      81
                 beta               0.6.2      230
                 edge               0.6.2      231
                 beta/fix-test-062  0.6.2      230         2022-05-13T11:10:26Z
```

After a snap has been promoted, the branch will remain in-place until its expiry.

For more details on promoting snaps to different channels, see [Release management](/t/release-management/12442).

<h2 id='heading--default'>Setting a default track</h2>

All snaps have a default track. When not specified explicitely, a snap is installed from the default track and without the snap publisher specifying otherwise, the default track is called _latest_

A default track can be specified manually with _snapcraft_ when a snap has more than one track:

```
snapcraft set-default-track <snap-name> <default-track-name>
```

When no track is specified at install time, an _implicit track_ install will install from `<default-track-name>` instead of `latest`:

```bash
snap install <snap-name>
```

Note that the default track does NOT remove latest; latest is never a pointer to another track and remains available:

```bash
snap install <snap-name> --channel=latest
```
