# The ant plugin

The `ant` plugin is useful for [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)-based parts and is commonly used to build Java projects with the [Ant snap](https://snapcraft.io/ant).

This plugin installs the specified version of *ant* and runs the configured build. Any jar files created by the build inside the target directory, directly inside the root of the source tree, will be copied to `${SNAP}/jar` in the resulting archive.

`CLASSPATH` will be set to the list of jars in `${SNAP}/jar` and `bin/java` is available as a symlink to the installed version of OpenJDK.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources". For more information, see [Snapcraft parts metadata](/t/snapcraft-parts-metadata/8336).

This plugin is only available to *core22* and *core18* based snaps. See [Base snaps](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/base-snaps/11198) for details.

      Defaults to `latest/stable`.

      OpenJDK version available to the base to use. If not set the latest version available to the base will be used.

      Defaults to the current release downloadable from

- **`ant-version-checksum`** (string)
      The checksum for ant-version in the form of <digest-type>/<digest>.
