 **NOTE TO EDITORS** 

This is work in progress.

This document is reference material, where possible, the attribute should include the version it was introduced or deprecated in. Links to more in-depth explanations for these resources are welcome as well as links to reasons for the deprecation.

See [Classic confinement](/t/snap-confinement/6233) for more details. <br> **Examples:** `app-launch` for an executable placed under `$SNAP/bin`. With `classic` confinement, `bin/app-launch` for an executable placed under `$SNAP/bin`. <br> **Note:** The command must consist only of alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following special characters: / . _ # : $ -.

The parent process is then expected to exit when start-up is complete <br> - `notify`: the command configured will send a signal to systemd to indicate that it's running.  See [Services and daemons](/t/services-and-daemons/12601) for further details.|
