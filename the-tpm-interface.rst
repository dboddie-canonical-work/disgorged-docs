The tpm interface
=================

``tpm`` allows access to the Trusted Platform Module (tpm) device, ``/dev/tpm0``, and to the in-kernel resource manager, ``/dev/tpmrm0``, on recent kernels (at least *v4.12*)

**Auto-connect**: no

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See `Interface management <interface-management.md>`__ and `Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces.md>`__ for further details on how interfaces are used.
