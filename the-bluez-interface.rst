The bluez interface
===================

``bluez`` enables access to the bluez Bluetooth service.

The plug is the client and the slot provides access to the bluez (Bluetooth) service. Connecting the two allows a client to access devices registered by the bluez service through the slot.

For example, a game with a *bluez* plug could connect to the system’s *bluez* slot to access a Bluetooth game controller.

**Auto-connect**: no

   ⓘ This is a snap interface. See `Interface management <interface-management.md>`__ and `Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces.md>`__ for further details on how interfaces are used.
